Anonymous link for DATE'24 conference. We will make the complete synthesizable HLS design open-source if accepted. 
The figures are (1) Xilinx Vitis HLS synthesis report and (2) Vivado implementation report for the proposed component-wise cLSTM training accelerator (including dynamic method of 20 timesteps and static method of 140 timesteps).
